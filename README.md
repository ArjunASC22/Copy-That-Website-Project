# Copy-That-Website-Project
A replica of the Microsoft website homepage 

This is my best attempt to replicating the homepage of https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ as it was on July 28, 2022, using only HTML and CSS. To run the project, use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or just open the HTML file in your browser (works best with Chrome).
